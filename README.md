# E-Destroyer McSnake 1325.2 (The Beginning)

My first programming project. Originates from a time when I was learning Java and is based on a framework/tutorial found here: http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J8d_Game_Framework.html

This has been gathering dust in my projects folder and I thought I'd bring it into the light. Honestly, the code is pretty messy. This is due to the fact that I was learning and expirimenting with Java as I wrote it. However, the GAME is pretty darn fun.

I will include an executable to launch the game when I get some time. Or just navigate to the Window class and run that (I think that's where main is...). 

I have/had plans for an epic storyline, music, better visuals (no lame backgrounds?), a config file, high scores board, pause menu with item descriptions and other stuff, etc but other projects have taken over.

Have fun!
Alex
